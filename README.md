# PDF-to-TXT

The two files can be used to transform a PDF to a TXT file (main.py), and then reformat to correct the process of conversion. 
This can be employed to process a large number of PDFs and create a small database of information in TXT format. 
It's easier for GPT or other chatbots to reference the information when it is in TXT format.
