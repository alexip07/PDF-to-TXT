# PDF-to-TXT

The two files can be used to transform a PDF to a TXT file (main.py), and then reformat to correct the process of conversion. 
This can be employed to process a large number of PDFs and create a small database of information in TXT format. 
It's easier for GPT or other chatbots to reference the information when it is in TXT format.

# UPDATE

I added a new file that scrapes through the TXT file. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done. It may still encounter some issues with files that aren't converted properly, but all in all, it's great.
